This is for the ones who heard the fight for freedom calling
For the ones who answered, "I'll do what I can"
For the ones who ran to battle
Who believed that freedom mattered
Oh this is for you

And this is for the ones whose orders took them to the front lines
For the ones who fell and never made it home
For the ones who came back broken
With memories too hard to be spoken
Oh this is for you

We remember
We remember
We are thankful
We are grateful
We know freedom isn't free
We remember
We remember
The gift you gave
The price you paid
Is not in vain
And it will never be forgotten
'Cause we remember

And this is for the ones whose war is wondering and waiting
For the moms and dads and families back at home
Those with pictures by their beds
Who had to learn to live again
Oh this is for you

We remember
We remember
We are thankful
We are grateful
We know freedom isn't free
We remember
We remember
The gift you gave
The price you paid
Is not in vain
And it will never be forgotten
We remember

We remember
Every time we chase our dreams
Or pray out loud
Speak our minds
And even when we disagree
Oh we remember
And though sometimes we've lost our way
We're still the land of the free and the home of the brave

And we remember
We remember
And we are thankful
We are grateful
We know freedom isn't free
We remember
We remember
The gift you gave
The price you paid
Is not in vain
And it will never be forgotten
We remember
